QuakeHeroes is an innovative software developed for the NASA Space Apps challenge, designed as a web immersion using the Flask framework with HTML and CSS templates. This project aims to assist lunar and Martian modules in detecting seismic tremors across the solar system, optimizing energy consumption in space missions.

Objective

The goal of QuakeHeroes is to provide an efficient platform for monitoring seismic activities on various celestial bodies, such as the Moon and Mars. Our solution uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify signs of seismic tremors and issue alerts, allowing scientific modules to adjust their systems, conserving energy and extending the longevity of missions.

Key Features

•	Seismic Tremor Detection: Utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze seismic data in real-time.
•	Lunar and Martian Monitoring: Capability to monitor multiple locations across the solar system.
•	Energy Efficiency: Our system automatically adjusts detection modules to ensure minimal energy usage during low seismic activity.
•	Immersive Web Interface: The platform offers a simple, visually appealing user interface, built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
How the Algorithm Works

Our AI algorithm is designed to recognize seismic tremor patterns based on large volumes of data from previous NASA missions and other space agencies. It learns from this data and improves its accuracy over time, enabling reliable detection. By optimizing sensor operations based on the detected activity, we reduce energy consumption during periods of seismic inactivity.​⬤
